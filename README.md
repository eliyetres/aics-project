### Project Description

I want to see if there is an improvement in  movie genre classification based  on movie poster images if you add the name of the title. A movie poster is usually the first impressions which gives you an idea about the movie content and its genre. Humans can get an idea based on things like colour, objects, expressions on the faces of actors to quickly determine the genre (horror, comedy, action etc).  Movie posters are created to attract people paying time and money to watch the movie. They  usually include a lot of features. For example, a violent scene with a crashed car and the actor with gun is created to attract people who like excitement or violence. If humans are more or less able to predict genre of a movie only giving a look at its poster, then it's possible to assume that the poster has some characteristics which could be used in machine learning to predict its genre.

### Approach

In order to do that a Deep Neural Network (Convolutional Neural Network) is constructed to classify a given movie poster image into genres. Since a movie may belong to multiple genres, this is a multi-label image classification problem.

### Dataset
